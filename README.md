# 🚗 Vehicle Market Analysis – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was inspired by a real-life request from a client.

The client wanted help choosing a car but had very specific requirements. They needed a vehicle that would be:

- Affordable  
- Fuel-efficient  
- Durable and reliable  
- Relatively low in mileage  

Instead of giving advice based on personal opinion, I decided to approach the problem using data analytics.

Using a real-world vehicle dataset and Power BI, I analyzed multiple car options and built an interactive dashboard to help identify the best possible choice.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project was simple:

To recommend the most suitable car for a buyer based on four major factors:

✔ Budget-friendly price  
✔ Good fuel efficiency  
✔ Long-term durability  
✔ Lower mileage  

The project aimed to turn raw vehicle data into clear, practical insights that could guide a smart purchasing decision.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset used for this analysis contains vehicle records from **2000 to 2023**, covering over 20 years of market data.

It includes attributes such as:

- Car brands  
- Car models  
- Manufacturing years  
- Fuel types  
- Transmission types  
- Engine sizes  
- Prices  
- Mileage  

### Dataset Summary

- 30 different car models  
- 10 car brands  
- 4 fuel types  
- 23 years of historical data  

This dataset provided enough depth to perform meaningful comparisons across brands and models.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – for data transformation, analysis, and visualization  
- Microsoft Excel / CSV – as the data source  
- Data analytics techniques including:
  - Filtering  
  - Aggregation  
  - Comparative analysis  
  - Dashboard design  

---

## 📊 Analytical Process

To arrive at the final recommendation, I followed these steps:

1. Imported the dataset into Power BI  
2. Cleaned and prepared the data  
3. Created calculated measures and relationships  
4. Built interactive visuals to analyze:
   - Average price by model  
   - Mileage by brand  
   - Price by fuel type  
   - Engine size trends  
5. Applied filters based on the client’s needs  
6. Narrowed down options to the most suitable vehicle

## 🖥 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created to allow users explore the data dynamically.

### The dashboard allows filtering by:

- Year range  
- Brand  
- Fuel type  
- Transmission type  

### Key Visuals Included:

- Average price of car model  
- Average mileage by brand  
- Price of Car by fuel type  
- Size of Brand Engine  
- KPI cards for quick insights

This dashboard transformed complex data into simple, easy-to-understand insights.

## 🔍 Key Findings

The analysis revealed several important insights:

- Most brands had similar price ranges, so price alone could not determine the best car.
- Mileage played a major role in identifying reliable options.
- Petrol vehicles offered the best balance of cost and practicality.
- Filtering based on affordability and mileage significantly reduced the available options.

---

## 🏆 Final Recommendation

After analyzing all the factors using Power BI, the most suitable car for the client was:

### **Toyota Corolla (2013–2016 models)**

### Why This Choice?

The Toyota Corolla best satisfied all requirements:

- ✔ Affordable to purchase  
- ✔ Excellent fuel efficiency  
- ✔ Proven long-term durability  
- ✔ Low maintenance cost  
- ✔ Availability of lower-mileage options  

Although cars like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord were good alternatives, the Corolla offered the best overall balance.
